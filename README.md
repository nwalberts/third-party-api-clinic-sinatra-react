### Git Stuff 
- git versus github 
- init, add, commit (and Atom)
- pulling a repo down 
- switching branches and fetch 
- pushing work up 


### External APIs

* External APIs are like Sinatra routes on someone elseâ€™s application
* Their purpose: they provide information or media that we can make HTTP requests for
* Use of external APIs is VERY common, so learning how to consume information from one is important

### Third Party API Process
* Find the API
* Look at its documentation
* Apply for a key (if required)
* Test the API endpoint with your key
* Integrate into your application with an object
  * Ideally make the request from the backend
  * Do not use fetch() if the API requires a key
